🎫 Streamlining Ticket Assignment for Efficient Support Operations

📌 Project Overview

At ABC Corporation, manual ticket assignment led to delays, misrouting, and uneven workload distribution. To overcome these challenges, we developed an Automated Ticket Assignment System that intelligently routes support tickets to the right team in real time.

🚀 Solution

The system was built on ServiceNow Flow Designer, with a custom table "Operations Related" that assigns tickets automatically based on the Issue field.
